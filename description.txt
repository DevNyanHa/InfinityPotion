InfinityPotion

InfinityPotion is a quality-of-life mod that allows infinite use of potions and certain consumables.  
It reduces unnecessary resource consumption and removes the hassle of managing potions during combat or exploration.  

Each infinite-use feature can be individually toggled through the configuration menu.

This mod is server-side.
